1.How much time have you spent on the technical test?
3 Hour and 36 minutes.

2. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? (If you
didn't spend much time on the technical test, then use this as an
opportunity to explain what you would add.)

An option to compare the values of the TextEditor to validate there were inserted but using Chai, since it will be easier and less code.


3. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

Without a doubt, is open source tools and frameworks.
Everyday new frameworks are coming out on how to automate, faster and with less code.
Also people are focused on making automate like writing a normal language, A good example is chai, you can literally read the code, and understand it
like you are reading a regular book.
More and more companies are adapting devops, Testing plays a business-critical role as developers are involved not just in the correctness of their code,
but also in the testing and overall Quality engineering aspects. Helping on delivery faster and better quality results.

4. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application?

In order to automate a legacy application, you need to have te big picture of the project to identify the areas which most attentions
is needed. It can be really hard to cover the entire application, a good approach is to build enough coverage for the
business critical sections of the applictaion, and gradually move to ther parts. 
If you can ignore GUI and go straight into the backend to test the functionality, it will save you time, and get better results faster.

Have you ever had to do this?
No
5. How would you improve the customer experience of the “The
Internet” website?

AVOID using frames! Haha usually is not easy to handle pages, which contain frames and other content, which can make you
switch focus between one and another, thus allowing you to have a high percentage of errors in your code.

6. If you could work in any company in the world, which company would
you choose and why?

I don't have a specific company, but more of a work environment.
For me the perfect company, is were the work environment can allow you to feel like in home, allowing you to enjoy your work.
You might be working for the big places (google, apple, amazon), but if you don't enjoy what you do, there is no point on working there.
